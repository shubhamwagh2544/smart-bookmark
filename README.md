# Smart Bookmark

## Requirements
Build and deploy a simple bookmark manager with the following requirements:

1. User can sign up and log in using Google (no email/password Google OAuth only)

2. A logged-in user can add a bookmark (URL + title)

3. Bookmarks are private to each user (User A cannot see User B's bookmarks)

4. Bookmark list updates in real-time without page refresh (if you open two tabs and add a bookmark in one, if should appear in the other)

5. User can delete their own bookmarks

6. App must be deployed on Vercel with a working live URL

Tech stack: Next.js (App Router, not Pages Router), Supabase (Auth, Database, Realtime), Tailwind CSS for basic styling
